# CSV Reader  Component

This React component allows users to upload a CSV file and displays its contents in a table format.

## Features

- Reads and parses CSV files using the `papaparse` library.
- Handles CSV files with or without headers.
- Skips empty lines in the CSV.
- Dynamically renders the CSV data in an HTML table.

## Usage

1.  **Installation:**
    Make sure you have `react` and `papaparse` installed in your project. If not, you can install them using npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install react papaparse
    # or
    yarn add react papaparse
    ```

2.  **Import the Component:**
    Import the `CsvReader` component into your React application:

    ```javascript
    import CsvReader from './CsvReader'; // Adjust the path as needed
    ```

3.  **Use the Component:**
    Include the `<CsvReader />` component in your JSX where you want the CSV reader to appear:

    ```jsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>My CSV App</h1>
          <CsvReader />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

4.  **Running the Application:**
    Start your React development server. Once the application is running in your browser, you will see a "Choose File" button.

5.  **Uploading a CSV:**
    Click the "Choose File" button and select a `.csv` file from your computer.

6.  **Viewing the Data:**
    Once the file is selected, the component will parse the CSV data and display it in a table below the button. If the CSV file had headers, they will be used as the table headers.

## Notes

- The `header: true` option in `Papa.parse` assumes the first row of your CSV file contains headers. If your CSV does not have headers, you can remove this option.
- The component includes basic styling for the table with a `border="1"` attribute. You can further customize the table appearance using CSS.
- Error handling for file reading or parsing issues is not included in this basic example. You might want to add error handling for a more robust application.
